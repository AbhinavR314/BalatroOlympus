# BalatroOlympus
Mod for the game Balatro adding Greek mythology based Jokers, made using Steamodded

Current Progress (4/?)

I am not an artist, so the art is very rudimentary. Get in touch if you want to improve it.

# Jokers:
Artemis (Rare): adds a "The Moon" Tarot card when Blind is selected.

Apollo (Rare): adds a "The Sun" Tarot card when Blind is selected.

Hephaestus (Rare): all cards become Steel cards when scored.

Hades (Uncommon):  if first hand of round has only 1 card, destroy it and earn $3

~work in progress below~

Hermes: gain [] money for each previous Blind skipped when Blind is selected

Athena:
